# xlydn
An in-the-works Discord and Twitch bot, run locally by the streamer

Before you try to run this, heres a good idea if it'll work or not: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IAmTomahawkx/xlydn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IAmTomahawkx/xlydn) \
As for how to run it, You'll need python 3.7 (3.8 might work, **not** 3.9).\
Install the requirements with
```
py -3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if you're on windows, or 
```
python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
on MacOS/Linux. \
Run it with
```
python3.7 launcher.py
```
